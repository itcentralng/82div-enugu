                    <p>Headquarters 82 Division Area of Responsibility covers the entire South East States comprising Anambra, Abia, Enugu, Ebonyi and Imo States and the South-South State of Cross River's State respectively. The Division was established in 1975, General Mamman Jiya Vatsa established the doctrinal basis for the establishment of 82 Division, including it's naming after 82nd West African Division. In 1982 Colonel Musa Bityong aided the establishment of the first Airborne of a "Can do, special forces" officer "a soldier's soldier" squad in the Division. The Division is a composite Division operating on air, land and the riverine domains. Its amphibious operations are usually conducted within the riverine area of Abia, Anambra, Imo and Cross River States.</p>

                    <h2>2.</h2>
                    <p>The Division is one of the maneuvers divisions of the Nigerian Army (NA) and it derives its roots from Camp HQ 2 Bde Lagos in 1961, which as a small administrative unit expanded and eventually metamorphosed into the Lagos Garrison Organization (LGO). In 1975, the LGO became the 4th Infantry Division of the NA. Following the reorganization of the NA in 1980, the 4th Infantry Division was re-designated 82 Composite Division and relocated to Enugu in 1981. The Figure '82' was chosen to honour the Nigerian soldiers who fought in the 82nd Division of the West African Frontier Force during the Burma Campaign of the Second World War. The Division was relocated to Enugu because of the envisaged threat in the operational environment from the eastern flank of Nigeria that may necessitate the conduct of land, sea and air operations. This also accounts for the composite designation of the Division.</p>

                    <h2>3.</h2>
                    <p>The Division is now simply called 82 Division Nigerian Army and its mascot is the Dragon, while its Motto is 'Firepower and Versatility'. The Division's Logo changed from the 'Palm Tree' of the Lagos Garrison Organization, first to the more aggressive 'Scorpion' adopted by the then 4th Infantry Division and later to the present 'Dragon'. The Dragon is a mythical fire-spitting, man eating reptile fabled to be able to swim, walk and fly. It is generally believed that the dragon was firm and audacious, such that when it gripped an object with its claws, it would not let go until it either tore it apart or mauled it in one way or the other. The Division was thus founded upon the characteristics of a Dragon. The logo of the Division has the Dragon superimposed on a background of 3 colours; namely deep blue, sky blue and brown. The deep blue represents water, the sky blue represents air and brown represents land; depicting its amphibious, airborne, and land capabilities respectively.</p>

Since then, it has become an integral part of the Division's identity. It was subsequently designed by Captain (later Colonel) Ibrahim Bature and a team of soldiers and local artists. The Dragon mascot embodies key values of the 82 Division which are highlighted below:</p>
